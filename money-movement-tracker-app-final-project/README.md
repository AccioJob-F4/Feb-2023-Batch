1. Problem Statement :
   Build an expense tracker where you will have two pages with routes “/” and “/add-expense” which are accessible after user has logged in (use https://reqres.in/ as the backend server to login). Route “/” will contain all the expenses that have been recorded. Use redux store to store expenses. In “/” route there should be three filters (input fields + dropdown) where you can add month (input field) and year (input field) and money movement type (dropdown with values (Income/Expense)) to filter out expense for that month and year. Each expense should have : Description, Date, Status (Income/Expense), Title, Amount in rupees, Id (uniqid npm package is to be used), Delete option. Feel free to use any react templating library.

2. Topics Covered :
   React Routing, React Templating Library, Redux, Github Deployment, Login flow, LocalStorage, API call with Axios, Error Handling, Working with Forms, Hooks.

3. Features :
   a. Add Money movement (Income/Expense) with detail.
   b. Filter out data based on multiple filters available.
   c. CRUD operation on Expense Data.
   d. User Authentication.
